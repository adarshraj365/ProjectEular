// this problem is actually related to prime factorisation .
/*
1 = 1
2 = 1 x 2
3 = 1 x 3

4 = 2 x 2 
5 = 1 x 5 
6 = 2 x 3

7 = 1x 7
8 = 2 x 2 x 2
9 = 3 x 3
10 = 2 x 5

so answer is lest prime factorors that we need to generate new number like 

ans = 2*3*2*5*7*2*3 =  2520 from these numbers we can generate all numbers from 1 to 10 


similarly if we solve for 1 to 20 

the minimum we need is : 11*2*2*3*10*7*5*2*2*17*3*19 = 232792560 (answer) ..
